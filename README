README for py-roms2roms

This fork provides some modified versions of the scripts to provide
ERA5 and Mercator processing using pre-downloaded monthly files
already on the hard disk. it also includes overlap processing.

make_mercator.py
make_era.py
make_mercator_ini.py

Note there are some considerable modifications that make these files 
incompatible with the original pyroms2roms.

BASED ON PYROMS2ROMS
Version 1.0.1

py-roms2roms is a Python version of roms2roms (see Mason etal, 2010 and
www.molemaker.org) that was written in Matlab.

pyroms2roms creates ROMS boundary files for offline nesting, but it has
expanded to make:

(1) boundary files with SODA, Mercator, ECCO2, IBI
(2) forcing files using CFSR and/or CCMP.
