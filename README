README for py-roms2roms

This fork provides some modified versions of the scripts to provide
ERA5 and Mercator processing using pre-downloaded monthly files
already on the hard disk. it also includes overlap processing.

make_mercator.py
make_era.py
make_mercator_ini.py

Only bulk fluxes for the moment.

Dependencies:
Be aware that Basemap from mpl_toolkits is required: 
https://matplotlib.org/basemap/users/installing.html
as well as NetCDF4 and the usual suspects (numpy, scipy, pylab)

Note there are some considerable modifications that make these files 
incompatible with the original pyroms2roms.

PLEASE USE WITH CAUTION.
Check the outputs carefully. I have used the outputs for a 5 year 
CROCO run with some basic performance assesments and I have not 
detected any issues as yet.

BASED ON PYROMS2ROMS
Version 1.0.1

py-roms2roms is a Python version of roms2roms (see Mason etal, 2010 and
www.molemaker.org) that was written in Matlab.

pyroms2roms creates ROMS boundary files for offline nesting, but it has
expanded to make:

(1) boundary files with SODA, Mercator, ECCO2, IBI
(2) forcing files using CFSR and/or CCMP.
